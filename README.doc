Instructions on how to start the app

The project is divided into two parts: 
	-Backend API with database which includes: API, Infrastructure and Core folders.
	-Frontend Angular SPA which is located in Client folder.

To run API you will need .NET 5.x SDK found here:
	https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

To run Angular you will need NodeJs and npm (comes with nodejs by default). NodeJs can be found here:
	https://nodejs.org/en/
Please use LTS version of Node (14.16.1) cause that is the version I used and angular might run into issues 
if you try installing it with the current version of Node (issues come from different npm versions).

If you already have the latest NodeJs installed this article shows a tool that can be used to quickly switch between versions.

After NodeJs and npm are installed you're ready to install angular by running this command in the terminal:
	npm install -g @angular/cli@11.2.6
@11.2.6 is the version I used, not strictly necessary to install that one but just in case. 
You might see a few warnings after install but those are not relevant to the project.

Now that everything is installed it's time to run the project. 
To start the API, open a terminal window, navigate to TimeFlix/API folder and enter: "dotnet run". 
This will start API server on port 5001 for https.

To start angular project inside a new terminal window, navigate to TimeFlix/client folder and enter: "ng serve -o". 
This will start SPA on port 4200. It might take a few minutes for the project to compile.

That's it! Everything should be working as intended with the frontend making requests to the API. 
But just in case there are any issues please send me an email at 10540097@mydbs.ie.

Inside the API folder, I've included a dependency flow diagram to better explain my backend structure.
